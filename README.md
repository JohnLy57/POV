# Persistance of Vision (POV) Game Display
By John Ly and Zesun Yang --- (ECE 4760 Final Project)


## Introduction:

Our team is really intrigued by POV displays and we wanted to explore how POV works. That’s what led us to this project. Unlike most POV projects we have seen on the internet that only plot static graphs, we designed a POV game that the user can interact with. The main character of the game is a green dinosaur, and it needs to dodge fireballs by jumping up. We used a box fan, a PIC32 microcontroller, an accelerometer and other sensors to create this cool game. When the user shakes the fan, the accelerometer detects it and informs the dinosaur to jump. It’s a fun project, and it’s also a good exercise for your arm.
